# REST-API-assignment
This is a Web tech assignment which demonstrates the functions of an API. An API is a application or software which handles the sharing of data and resources as well as acts as an intermediary between the user interface (front-end) and the server (back-end). The REST API is a set of instructions or rules controlling how developers manipulate data. Some of the basic operations of a REST API include the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

The GET endpoints were implemented by first using a get function which is part of the Express module and passing the respective routes as well as a calllback function (having req and res as parameters) as parameters. This callback function returns an output as a result of conditions which are met some after reading and parsing a JSON file. For example, if a developer attempts accessing a user's id which is not found in the file, then an error message should be displayed along with the status(either 404 or 500) indicating that the data does not exist. Otherwise, it should return the data as a JavaScript object.   

THis assignment has exposed me to the various operations and processes involved in the display of data in JSON format over a serever as well as to how Node.js fucntions. Although there were instances where my code was not functioning, I still enjoyed the experience and am willing to learn more about web development.
